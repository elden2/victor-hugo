Welcome to computer science from a novice.

I'm a math and physics teacher, but learning a bit of data science for fun.  Follow my progress as I play around and learn a bit about algorithms, cleaning data, programming, and general problem solving.  All comments, suggestions, hints, and general thoughts are encourgaged.
