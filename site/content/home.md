Welcome to computer science from a novice.

My name is Zach, and I'm a math and physics teacher out in California.  I've been learning a bit of data science and computer science for fun lately.  Follow my progress as I play around with algorithms, cleaning data, general programming, machine learning, and whatever else I find myself stumbling into.

There's no specific path or order to my projects.  They range from Kaggle competitions, to building very simple ML libraries, to <http://www.projecteuler.net> problems.  Really just a random assortment.  All comments, suggestions, hints, and general thoughts are encourgaged.
