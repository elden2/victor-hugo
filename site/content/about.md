I’ve recently begun learning a bit about data science, machine learning, and general computer science for fun.   Most of the computer science websites out there are written by experts (or at least people with some degree of expertise).  I'm a high school math and physics teacher, not a data scientist; I’m hoping this will be an opportunity to show a bit of the progression of a beginner and hobbyist.  With any luck, it will be useful or interesting to others who are just beginning out as well.  Comments, suggestions, advice, and questions are all welcome.

Almost everything here will be written in Python, which is the language I began writing in a few years ago.  (I started learning python in order to solve <http://www.projecteuler.net> problems, my version of sudoku or crossword puzzles.  If you've never tried them, they're a ton of fun - but a bit addicting).

​I've just started to post some of my code on GitHub:
