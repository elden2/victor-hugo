Welcome to computer science from a novice.

My name is Zach, and I'm a math and physics teacher out in California.  Once upon a time I was a mechanical engineer, so it's in my nature to build and tinker with things. Lately I've been learning a bit about programming, computer science, and data science.  All the pages here are the work of a novice playing around with algorithms, cleaning data, general programming, machine learning, and whatever else I find myself stumbling into.

There's no specific path or order to these projects.  They include  simple ML libraries I've built, Kaggle competitions, <http://www.projecteuler.net> problems, and demonstrations or explanations I built for my students. Really just a random assortment of things.  I value figuring out how things work, and the best way to figure out how something works is to build it.

I’m hoping this will be an opportunity to show a bit of my progression.  With any luck, it will be useful or interesting to others who are just beginning out as well.

All comments, suggestions, hints, and general thoughts are encouraged.
