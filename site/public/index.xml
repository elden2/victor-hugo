      <title>Classifying 311 Noise Complaint Data - Part I.</title>

      <description>Page 1 of 2 - Cleaning the Data
Create a model that can classify a noise complaint by type (i.e., commercial, vehicle, park, house of worship, etc.) The idea came from a friend, who I believe encountered it at a job interview at a now defunct company.
You can find the entire code and the smaller data set here: 311 Data
After playing around with Kaggle Competitions (if you&amp;rsquo;ve not see these, Predicting Survival on the Titanic is a great place to start, with tons of tutorials), I decided to look for data somewhere less structured.</description>

      <description>This was a pretty failed attempt. I got decent results, but for pretty aweful reasons that I should have seen at the very beginning
The following code comes from a Jupyter notebook. Next project is to figure out a way to import that notebook directly into this website.
First, lets grab our data and run a few classifiers just to see around where were at. I&amp;rsquo;m just using out of the box SciKit learn libraries instead of writting my own for this.</description>

      <description>Ulam Spirals
I remember coming across Ulam Spirals (also known as Prime Spirals) a few years back, and though they were fascinating.
Stanislaw Ulam (of the Teller-Ulam Hydrogen Bomb) discovered these while doodling in a conference (and I find myself doodling the same spiral when I&amp;rsquo;m board in meetings as well.)
It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple to understand the process, almost impossible to understand the why, and a fun little project to implement in python; all in all a perfect afternoon project.</description>

      <description>A program to write in the style of Moby Dick
The idea of a Markov Chain is pretty simple. Imagine you were to hear the beginning of the sentence &amp;ldquo;The United States of&amp;hellip;..&amp;rdquo; and you needed to fill in the rest. Chances are, at least if you are from San Francisco in 2018, you would assume &amp;ldquo;America&amp;rdquo; is the next word (as opposed to &amp;ldquo;The United States of Brazil,&amp;rdquo; (which was Brazil&amp;rsquo;s official name half a century ago).</description>

      <description>I’ve recently begun learning a bit about data science, machine learning, and general computer science for fun. Most of the computer science websites out there are written by experts (or at least people with some degree of expertise). I&amp;rsquo;m a high school math and physics teacher, not a data scientist; I’m hoping this will be an opportunity to show a bit of the progression of a beginner and hobbyist. With any luck, it will be useful or interesting to others who are just beginning out as well.</description>

      <description>Welcome to computer science from a novice.
My name is Zach, and I&amp;rsquo;m a math and physics teacher out in California. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a bit of data science and computer science for fun lately. Follow my progress as I play around with algorithms, cleaning data, general programming, machine learning, and whatever else I find myself stumbling into.
There&amp;rsquo;s no specific path or order to my projects. They range from Kaggle competitions, to building very simple ML libraries, to http://www.</description>
